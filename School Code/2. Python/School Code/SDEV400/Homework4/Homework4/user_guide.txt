Game Rules

In this game, you will need to navigate through a lap with 6 corners. For each corner, you must input 
a braking distance between 200 feet and 50 feet. The speed for each corner is fixed but varies between 
corners. The objective is to brake at the optimal distance for each corner to achieve the best lap time.

- The optimal lap time is 1 minute and 30 seconds.

Enjoy the game!
